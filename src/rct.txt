react components use props to communicate with each other
props might remind you HTML attributes
props are information that you pass to HTML tag
Props let you think about parent and child components independently

If you want to give a prop a default value to fall back on when no value is specified,
 you can do it with the destructuring by putting = and the default value right after the parameter:

 Props reflect a componentâ€™s data at any point in time, rather than only in the beginning.
